<h1 align="center">About Me</h1>
<p>I am Adarsh Pandey, a dedicated and enthusiastic Software Engineer with a passion for developing solutions that make a difference. Currently, I work at JIO Platforms, Navi Mumbai, where I automate and optimize backend systems to enhance service delivery and improve customer satisfaction. My expertise spans web technologies, backend development, and the integration of APIs to build high-performance applications. 

I graduated with a B.Tech. in Computer Science & Engineering from United College of Engineering & Management, Prayagraj. During my academic journey, I cultivated a strong foundation in programming and system architecture, equipping me with the necessary skills to tackle real-world software challenges.

One of the most valuable experiences in my career was my training at CodeQuotient, where I specialized in full-stack web development using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). I gained hands-on experience in building dynamic web applications, designing PostgreSQL schemas, and optimizing application performance. 

At JIO, I work on automating network management processes, developing backend solutions, and ensuring high service reliability. I also contributed to the 5G Feasibility Development project, helping to enhance the robustness of the POS systems.

My technical expertise includes JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, React, Python, SQL, MongoDB, Solana Blockchain, and various developer tools. I am highly proficient in developing scalable solutions, optimizing code, and creating seamless user experiences. 

In addition to my core technical skills, I am constantly learning and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies to improve my problem-solving abilities. My goal is to continuously improve my technical skills, contribute to impactful projects, and work in a collaborative environment that encourages innovation.</p>
